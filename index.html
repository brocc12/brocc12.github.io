  One of the highlights of my experience has been delving into the world of data analysis. The course has provided me with a rock-solid foundation in its pre-work, especially when it comes to working with essential packages like pandas and numpy. These tools, which were once intimidating, are now becoming my trusted companions as I navigate the vast landscape of data analysis. Understanding how to manipulate and analyze data has given me a newfound confidence in my abilities.

They create an environment where questions are encouraged, challenges are embraced, and learning is a collaborative journey. I am grateful for their guidance as they lead us through the intricate world of data analysis.

Excitement for the Future:
  As I reflect on this first week, I can't help but feel a sense of anticipation for what lies ahead. The future at Flatiron School seems incredibly promising, with endless opportunities for growth and exploration. Today we looked at examples of previous students Phase 5 projects, AKA the final week, and I was hit with a healthy mix of intimidation and excitement. I can't wait to apply what I've learned and see how far my newfound skills will take me.
